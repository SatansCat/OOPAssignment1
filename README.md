## Instructions for use:
Click into the window then try to hit as many targets as you can!
Controls are below.
(Targets with more rings are harder to get rid of... 3 shots)
(red targets are about to detonate)
(targets that are further away are harder to hit)

## Controls:
Mouse: aim
Space: shoot
e: Teleport to the other side of the range
q: Use ultimate (hits all targets, warning: this will not count towards your score, high score chasers beware!)
s: Start again (when in game over screen)

## Favorite bits
I Tryed to keep as much code within classes, and their super classes.
I perticularly enjoyed drawing in the outline of the visor at the start, thought it might serve as an interesting "Boot up" sequence.
